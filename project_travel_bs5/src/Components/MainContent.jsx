            Authentic, Natural and Cultural are the words that best capture the essence of Romania,
            a dynamic country rich in history, arts and scenic beauty.
            Romania offers countless unique travel experiences that are waiting to be discovered.
            A journey of three to four hours, by car or train, can take you
            from the Danube River to a beautiful, intact, medieval town;
            from Bucharest - Romania-s capital city - to the Black Sea;
            from Southern Transylvania to Bucovina or Maramures regions.
            Take a step back in time as you visit one of the unique Painted Monasteries in Bucovina,
            the perfectly preserved hilltop citadel of Sighisoara or an authentic, centuries-old, village in Maramures.
            Explore Romani-s many architectural treasures and experience its vibrant and flourishing arts scene.
            We are looking forward to welcoming you to Romania!
